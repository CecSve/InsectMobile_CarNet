# Detecting flying insects using car nets and DNA metabarcoding #

This repository (R project) contains all scripts necessary to run the ecological/statistical analyses from the study "Detecting flying insects using car nets and DNA metabarcoding" (Svenningsen et al.).

The data were collected in June 2018 as part of the citizen science project InsectMobilen ("Insektmobilen") at the Natural History Museum of Denmark.
