# Detecting flying insects using car nets and DNA metabarcoding #

This repository (R project) contains all scripts necessary to run the ecological/statistical analyses from the study "Detecting flying insects using car nets and DNA metabarcoding" (Svenningsen et al.).

The data were collected in June 2018 as part of the citizen science project InsectMobilen ("Insektmobilen") at the Natural History Museum of Denmark. 

## Preparation of ASV tables and sequencing data ##

## Description of the sub directories for the sequence data processing ##

* raw-data: contains all the data used before sample matching for the statistical analysis, e.g. metadata from the laboratory, the DADA2/LULU output and the GBIF occurrence downloads. 
* cleaned-data: contains tables generated by the scripts used in the analysis, e.g. merging samples by original samples and not by size class, new species for the country and the region and coordinates for the sample routes etc.
* reports: a step-wise list of scripts (01_, 02_ etc.) used for processing and analysing the data
* plots: figures generated by the scripts and other plots not used in the manuscript
